i've left the original 3sx readme below, but there's a few notes to it i'd like to add.

this is Street Fighter 3: Xrd strike, my shitty mod held together with bubblegum and dreams, yanderedev style.

updates aren't promised nor regular, if you want anything out of me related to this mod plase harass me on discord, my tag is `mommyplier_`.

also, no patch notes. i'm just ~~annoying~~ silly like that.
