# Config

3SX supports a config file which allows you to change several useful options.

Config location:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\CrowdedStreet\3SX\config`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/CrowdedStreet/3SX/config`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/CrowdedStreet/3SX/config`

## Options

### `fullscreen`

Whether the game should start in fullscreen mode.

### `window-width` / `window-height`

Window dimensions to use when `fullscreen` is set to `false`.

### `scale-mode`

The way the internal 384x224 buffer is scaled.

Possible values:
- `nearest` (default): Produces sharp pixels at the cost of sizing consistency
- `integer`: Produces a pixel-perfect image, but requires a 4K display
  - ⚠️ WARNING: the image is gonna be cropped if your display resolution is smaller than 2688x2016
- `square-pixels`: The internal buffer is scaled up by an integer (whole number) factor. Use this if you play on a CRT

### `draw-players-above-hud`

Allow characters to render in front of the top HUD similar to Street Fighter IV. May introduce visual abnormalities on certain stages.

### `arcade-balance` (experimental)

Enables arcade balance instead of PS2 balance (work in progress). Requires `sfiii3nr1.zip` to be present in `resources` directory.
